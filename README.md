# The-Brighton-Times
Making The Brington Times responsive

## Procedure
The first step is to make everything in the main.css have a width of 100%
Then adding some break points. ( bellow 550px I added a menu with the humburger icon)
Last step is to add some more minor breakpoints

## Progression
The width is set to 100% for most objects
The menu icon appears bellow 550px but the script i wrote to make it work isnt working yet
